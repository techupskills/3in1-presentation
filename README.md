**2. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/techupskills/3in1-presentation?quickstart=1)

**3. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for a long time (10 or more minutes) while it gets everything ready.

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment, install needed python pieces, install Ollama, and then download the models we will use. This will take several more minutes to run. 

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.
